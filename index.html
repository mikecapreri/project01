        <h2>About this Project:</h2>
        <p>This project was in some instances, vey challenging. While I have previously used bootstrap as well as created advanced, professional looking webpages in the past, I find that I am still relatively rusty. What was helpful about this project is that it provided me with a large-scale assignment and forced me to figure out how to do it. Instead of having a tutorial to guide me through, I had to effectively figure out my own ways to solve my problems that arose. I think this is an important skill.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>In some cases, I had to do away with particular things that I just didn’t like once I got them completely figured out. I was able to rework some things in order to hide that I was struggling at getting a specific look that I felt was satisfactory. For example, the navigation bar started out painstakingly difficult as I worked tirelessly to create 3 individual block elements for each link. Upon the realization that I couldn’t get the three block elements as close as I wanted, I had to dismantle all of my hard work and redo it as a single bar across the top with text elements separated by padding and margin.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I found myself looking back at the bootstrap assignment I did for my previous web design class, often stealing my own layout styles and reworking this new piece by borrowing elements from the previous assignment. This was very helpful and gave me something to lean on when I struggled to set something up. However, I often found myself getting lost trying to figure out how I did what I had previously done.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>If I were to improve a portion of this project, it would be to find a way to make my failures work the way I wanted them to. I wish I had allotted myself more time to figure out how to solve my problems. I would change the arrangement of the nav bar and I think I would have made Page 1 more tidy and cleaner looking.</p>
